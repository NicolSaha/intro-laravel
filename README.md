# ✨ Introduction to Laravel
## 📓 [Assignment](https://github.com/becodeorg/gnt-yu-3-21/tree/master/3.The-Mountain/7.Laravel)
A local restaurant has seen a decline in the number of clients in the past year. They decided to hire a new chef, renovate the furniture and develop a new menu.
They could wait a few months to see if the changes work, but they would like some feedback earlier. They ask you to build them a simple website to collect reviews from the new clients.

## 💭 Must-haves
- 2 pages: Home, and Reviews
- Homepage: a few pictures of the restaurant, and a menu with only 3 choices of meal, no drinks, and no desserts.
- Reviews page: a form to collect reviews with: name of the reviewer (required), 1-5 star choice (required), comment (optional)
- Reviews page will show the last 10 reviews submitted
- Header of both pages will contain the restaurant's logo and the links to the two pages (Home and Reviews)
- Footer of both pages will contain the restaurant's address and opening hours
